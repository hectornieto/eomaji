## Beneficiaries

## African Early Adopters
**The Ministry of Agriculture** and Irrigation Development of Burkina Faso (MoABF) is responsible for the implementation of the policies defined by the Government of Burkina Faso regarding agricultural matters. To that purpose, MoABF has the responsibility of, among others, analyzing, forecasting, orienting and monitoring the performance of the State agricultural services, taking into account the capacities of the non-state sector (farmers' organization, other private operations and NGOs). In addition MoABF is in charge of supporting and advising food producers for raising their technical and management level as well as improving the productivity of their farms. MoABF will provide in situ data on yield (rice, maize and/or sorghum) and irrigation, organize webinars, and give feedback on their technical and operational needs.

**The Department of Water and Sanitation of Botswana (DWA)** is one of the departments belonging to the Ministry of Land Management, Water and Sanitation Services. DWA has the national responsibility for policy, planning, assessment, of Botswanaâ€™s scarce water resources, including the allocation of water to the different sectors of the economy. DWA is the sole responsible for surface water assessment, while it shares the responsibility of groundwater assessment with the other departments of the Ministry. DWA also acts as the Secretariat to the water apportionment board (WAB). The WAB is a statutory body established under the water act of 1956 to issue water abstraction and wastewater discharge rights to water consumers and/or users. To that end the mission of DWA is to plan, assess, develop and protect Botswana's water resources for sustainabl contribution to socio-economic growth. DWA will provide in situ data on irrigation and water use, engage relevant actors in webinars, give feedback on their technical and operational needs as well on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the developed solution. Botswana will set up a technical reference group, formed with experts from Water, Agriculture and Environment sectors, involved in water management, to evaluate the developed prototype and using it in a local context, and by participating in online meetings. 

**The Advanced Agriculture and Food Cluster of CSIR** has a long research and capacity building record on remote sensing and precision agriculture, and therefore will participate as African EO research partner. CSIR closely collaborates with the University of Preatoria -member of the Pan African University Space Science Institute- and actively participates in the GMES & Africa initiative. CSIR will participate in the development of the algorithm and in the evaluation of the prototype in a regional and educational context. In addition CSIR will help the consortium in searching and gathering of crop yield and irrigation data, and will participate in webinars, encouraging as well researchers, technicians and stakeholders to join the webinars.
